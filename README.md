# custom-shell

From wikipedia,
>In computing, a shell is a computer program that exposes an operating system's services to a human user or other programs. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation.

In this case, we are building a CLI to run commands. Implementing this will be useful in understanding more of the workings of a shell (like zsh).

### Functionality implemented
- Running commands infinitely until user hits `exit` 
- Executing commands without arguments (eg., `pwd`)
- Executing commands with arguments (eg., `ls -la`)
